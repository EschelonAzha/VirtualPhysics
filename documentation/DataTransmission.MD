# Virtual Physics Superpowers: Effortless Data Transmission

Virtual Physics reimagines data transmission by drawing inspiration from the fundamental laws of physics. It introduces a unique approach that eliminates the need for traditional serialization formats like JSON or XML, resulting in efficient and precise data exchange.

## Key Concepts

**Atoms, Molecules, and Compounds:**

- Atoms represent individual data fields.
- Molecules combine Atoms to create small structures.
- Compounds are complex structures, akin to objects or collections.

## Built-in Serialization and Deserialization

- **`emit()` function:** Seamlessly converts Atoms, Molecules, and Compounds into compact "photon strings."
- **`Absorber.materialize()` function:** Reconstructs the original object from a photon string.

## Advantages

- **Compact Size:** Photon strings are often 90% smaller than JSON.
- **Lossless Transmission:** No class information is lost.
- **No External Dependencies:** Eliminates the need for third-party serialization libraries.
- **Ease of Use:** Serialization and deserialization require only a single line of code each.

## Code Example

val addressRec = AddressRec()       // inherits from Compound
val emission  = addressRec.emit()   // emit() on first machine

// Transmit the photon emission to second machine .......


val (clone, _) = Absorber.materialize(emission)  
val addressRecClone = clone as AddressRec        




## Conclusion

Virtual Physics offers a powerful and innovative approach to data transmission, inspired by the laws of nature. Embrace these superpowers to streamline data exchange in your applications.
