Virtual Physics Data Binding

Since from a user point of view, everything is built from Atoms, there is no need (unless you want to ) to
look at how all the subatomic particles interact in order to create the capabilities found in the atoms.

One of the intrinsic properties of all atoms in the real world is that they can be bound together using electron
bonds.   These bonds give Virtual Physics another super power:  All atoms can be bound together in a circuit
of one and two-way data bindings as well as notifications via capacitors as well.  As such, the Atoms

Since Atoms have electrons and electrons can flow, we can use these features to build rudimentary electronic
circuits such as conductors, diodes, and capacitors.

Diodes are devices that allow electricity to flow in one direction only and as such are used to enable
one-way data binding.   Conductors allow current to flow in both directions and as such are used to enable
two-way data bindings.  Capacitors don't allow data flow but build up a capacitance change which will notify
and Atom of a change in value to it's associated bound Atom.   This is useful if we don't want the exact
value of the other atom to flow into our value, but want to take some action such as if the oppositely bound
value changes to "10" we can accept that value and double it and set our value to "20".   Capacitors act as notifiers
in the data binding process.
