# Effortless Data Transmission

Virtual Physics reimagines data transmission by drawing inspiration from the fundamental laws of physics. It introduces a unique approach that eliminates the need for traditional serialization formats like JSON or XML, resulting in efficient and precise data exchange.

## Key Concepts

**Atoms, Molecules, and Compounds:**

- Atoms represent individual data fields.
- Molecules combine Atoms to create small structures.
- Compounds are complex structures, akin to objects or collections.

## Built-in Serialization and Deserialization

- **`emit()` function:** Seamlessly converts Atoms, Molecules, and Compounds into compact "photon strings."
- **`Absorber.materialize()` function:** Reconstructs the original object from a photon string.

## Advantages

- **Compact Size:** Photon strings are often **90% smaller** than JSON or XML
- **Lossless Transmission:** No class information is lost.
- **No External Dependencies:** Eliminates the need for third-party serialization libraries.
- **Ease of Use:** Serialization and deserialization require only a single line of code each.

## Code Example

// Machine 1

val addressRec = AddressRec()       
**val emission  = addressRec.emit()**   

// ... Transmit the emission to the other machine....

// Machine 2

**val (clone, _) = Absorber.materialize(emission)**   
val addressRecClone = clone as AddressRec        




## Conclusion

Virtual Physics offers a powerful and innovative approach to data transmission, inspired by the laws of nature. Embrace these superpowers to streamline data exchange in your applications.


# Virtual Physics Data Binding: Simplifying the Complex with Atomic Power

From a user's perspective, Virtual Physics works its magic at the atomic level. You don't need to delve into the intricate interactions of subatomic particles to harness the power packed within each "Atom." These fundamental building blocks of data, like their real-world counterparts, possess an innate ability to bind together. This opens up a universe of possibilities – a world of effortless data binding built right into the atoms themselves.

## Connecting the Dots: Circuits of Data Flow

Imagine virtual electrons seamlessly weaving data connections between Atoms. Just like their real-world counterparts, these connections come in different flavors:

* **Conductors:** Allow data to flow freely in both directions, enabling two-way data binding.
* **Diodes:** Act as one-way valves, directing data flow like a digital traffic light, perfect for one-way data binding.
* **Capacitors:** Don't directly transmit data, but instead accumulate changes in potential like miniature data batteries. When triggered, they send notifications to bound Atoms, enabling reactive data binding without actual data exchange.

Think of a Capacitor as a watchful gatekeeper, alerting an Atom when its bound partner experiences a "voltage spike" in its value. This allows the Atom to react without directly receiving the new value, opening up possibilities for sophisticated conditional responses.

## The Power of Simplicity

This "atomic" approach to data binding offers several advantages:

* **Ease of Use:** Bind data with just a few lines of code, eliminating complex binding frameworks.
* **Flexibility:** Choose the right "circuit" for your needs, be it unidirectional, bidirectional, or reactive.
* **Efficiency:** Leverage built-in mechanisms for minimal overhead and optimal performance.

Virtual Physics Data Binding empowers you to build dynamic, responsive applications with intuitive ease. Unleash the power of the atom and watch your data dance!

## Conductors in Action: A Code Example

To illustrate this atomic ballet in action, let's examine a code snippet that demonstrates two-way data binding using conductors:

val atom1: Atom = Atom().with("ATOM1")

val atom2: Atom = Atom().with("ATOM2")

val atom3: Atom = Atom().with("ATOM3")

// Connect atom1 to atom2 and atom3, forming a synchronized circuit

### atom1.conductor_(atom2).conductor(atom3) 

// if any atomic value changes they all will change

and here is a code snippet to demonstrate diodes (one-way data-binding)

### atom1.diode_(atom2).diode(atom3)

// if atom2 changes, so will atom1 which is downstream from atom2 while atom3 will remain unchanged (upstream)

// however if atom3 changes, all three will change in order

**// furthermore, we can create circular dependencies:**

### atom1.diode_(atom2).diode_(atom3).diode_(atom1)

// if any value changes all values will change in order and this will not create an infinite loop
//
 
**Note:** 

An underscore after the diode_ ,  **atom1.diode_(atom2)** means the atom on the right will be returned as the target for the next diode.

An underscore before the _diode,  **atom1._diode(atom2)** means the atom (atom1) on the left will be returned as the target for the next diode.

Effectively, the _ points to the argument that will be returned next.  This allows diodes to be chained in sequence, or for tree shaped arrangements

**atom1._diode(atom2).diode(atom3)**  // atom2 and atom3 BOTH connect to Atom1

# Beta Decay in Virtual Physics: Unlocking Data Rollback using Isotopes

Virtual Physics draws inspiration from nuclear physics to introduce a powerful concept called beta decay. This mechanism enables flexible data manipulation and rollback capabilities within Atoms and Molecules.
All Atoms and Molecules at any time can be converted into new isotopes that store their previous values in 
Neutrons.  Yes it makes the atom heavier as in the real world, but it also gives all atoms the capability to
do built in rollbacks at any time.

## Key Concepts:

* **Beta Decay:**
Mimics the natural process of converting protons into neutrons, creating new isotopes.
Serves as a mechanism for storing previous values and enabling rollbacks.
* **Isotopes:**
Chemically equivalent Atoms with different numbers of neutrons, representing different states of data.

## Sample Code

val atom = Atom().with("InitialValue")

atom.betaPlusDecay("new value") // Atom now has a new value

atom.betaMinusDecay()           // Atom rolled back to its original value "InitialValue"

**This functionality is built in to all Atoms, Compounds, and Molecules**

# Building Blocks of Insight: Data's Chemical Revolution #

Rows morph into molecules, data fields become atoms and queries become catalytic filters, extracting insights with the precision of a chemist.

**Beyond Static Structures:** Built-in properties become defining elements, relationships blossom, and generic functions operate with ease. Data evolves into a dynamic landscape of interconnected molecules.

**Unleash the Potential:**

* **Adaptive Structures:** Build data structures that can bend and shift like nature's creations.
* **Intuitive Tools:** Craft easy-to-use tools for exploration and analysis, mirroring the simplicity of chemical reactions.
* **Hidden Patterns:** Uncover hidden connections and forge powerful insights, fueled by the magic of catalytic queries.
* **Elegant Efficiency:** Create a new generation of data systems that reflect nature's efficiency and grace.

* Code Example:

Kotlin

    class VTestChemistry {
        private val polymer = Polymer()

    init { // Add rows to polymers (natures repeating molecular structure)
        polymer.bind(AddressRow().with("name1", "address1", "city1", "state1"))
        polymer.bind(AddressRow().with("name2", "address1", "city1", "state1"))
        polymer.bind(AddressRow().with("name2", "address1", "city2", "state1"))
    }

    fun test(): Polymer {
        val filter = Filter().with(polymer)  // Create a Filter Catalyst
            .where(Name().with("name2"))
            .where(City().with("city2"))

        return filter.activate() as Polymer  // Execute the catalyst
    }
}

**// This sample builds a Polymer chain using AddressRow "molecules".**

**// Filter acts as a "catalytic function", extracting specific data.**

**// All other applied data-binding circuits and rollback capability still exist in the result set.**

## Elements Are Here !!
**Elements:** Elements are Self-Describing Building Blocks for Virtual Physics.
Elements serve as runtime interfaces in Virtual Physics, ensuring each element has the correct number of protons (e.g., Hydrogen: 1, Helium: 2, Lithium: 3).

**Key Attributes**
* **Value:** This core property represents the element's fundamental data relevant to your application e.g., ZipCode), and is the smallest Atom you can use (Hydrogen).
* **FieldName:** Specifies the name associated with the Value for clarity and organization.
* **Access Level:** Controls access and modification permissions for the Value within your application.
* **Alias Name:** Provides an alternative name for the FieldName, promoting readability and flexibility.
* **Custom Protons:** Beyond the minimum atomic number, additional protons can store application-specific metadata, making each element truly self-describing, and you can use and mix any combination of protons to create any element you need. -- The periodic Table gives us over a hundred elements we can choose from! 

**Unique Advantages**
* **Self-Describing:** Elements carry all necessary information, eliminating the need for external parsing tools (like for JSON or XML) to carry the meta-data.
* **Transmissible and Absorbable:** Atoms can be emitted and absorbed, facilitating data exchange and communication between different parts of your application.
* **Seamless Integration:** Works directly within your Virtual Physics environment, offering a natural and efficient way to represent and manipulate physical entities.
