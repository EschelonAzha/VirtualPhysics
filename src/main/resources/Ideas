Value Colors:

Red: Invalid value; violates constraints or exceeds allowable range.
Green: Valid value; meets all constraints and is within acceptable range.
Blue: Unknown value; awaiting validation against constraints.
Anti-Red: Value flagged for potential constraint violation, requiring further analysis.
Anti-Green: Value flagged for potential ambiguity or edge case, needing manual intervention.
Anti-Blue: Value cleared or reset, ready for new input.


Format Colors:

Red: Formatting rule applied but encountered constraint violation, resulting in partial or incorrect formatting.
Green: Formatting rule applied successfully, value presented accurately within constraints.
Blue: No formatting applied yet, awaiting formatting instructions.
Anti-Red: Formatting rule flagged for potential conflict or ambiguity, requiring review.
Anti-Green: Formatting rule flagged for unexpected data type, needing special formatting logic.
Anti-Blue: Formatting cleared or reset, value in raw form.


Constraint Colors:

Red: Constraint violated, potentially invalidating the value or requiring data correction.
Green: All constraints met, value conforms to all rules and restrictions.
Blue: Constraint awaiting evaluation, value validation still in progress.
Anti-Red: Potential constraint conflict or overlap identified, requiring manual rule refinement.
Anti-Green: Constraint flagged for edge case or uncommon data type, needing tailored validation methods.
Anti-Blue: Constraints cleared or reset, ready for new definition or application.

Value:
Anti-Blue: initial state with data missing or violating constraints (like non-null requirements)
Blue: initial state with valid data passing constraints.    Means it can remain initialized value

Anti-Red:   violates constraints
Red         violates validation

Anti-Green  passes constraints
Green       passes validation

Format:
Green:       Use As-Is
Anti-Green:  Use Format in Quark (ex:  MM/DD/YYYY)


Constraints:
Green:        Validation function supplied (if Spin +1, constraints as well)
Anti-Green:   Constraints supplied (Spin +1)
Blue:         No Constraints (Spin -1)
