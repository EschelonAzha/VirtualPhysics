class Transistor {
    /* Transistors are useful for controlling the flow of data.
       They can fall in between conductors and diodes.   We can allow certain
       people/transactions to flow while others may not be authorized.
       taking two inputs (who and what) yields to a single output.   Flow or no flow.
