class Resistor {
    /* Resistors can be used as components in a circuit to evaluate
       data and resist their flow if the data doesn't meet the criteria.
       they are different than capacitors because capacitors can resist
       but they can also change the arriving data into something else
       and pass it through.   Resistors should only validate and block.
       It doesn't mean no data goes through, it only means it resists
       the flow of data.   In this case, passing validation is the resistance.
