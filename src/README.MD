# Virtual Physics

VirtualPhysics is not a library to solve Physics problems. Instead, it's a library that uses the patterns in Physics to solve Software Engineering problems.

## The Goal

The goal of Virtual Physics is to transform programming into true Software Engineering, where we are governed by the same laws and patterns as "real" engineers. Chemical, Electrical, Mechanical, and Nuclear engineers are governed by the laws of Physics.  We are notâ€”until today.

Virtual Physics attempts to govern all programming through a single Universal Library based on the standard model of physics.

**Today, true Software Engineering begins.**
